<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>
<p>
Prohibition meetings in Scotland,
says an official, have been attended by
fifty thousand people. We should not
have thought there were so many aliens
in Scotland.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
At an Oldbury wedding the other day
a brick was thrown at the bridegroom.
There is no excuse for this sort of thing
with confetti so cheap.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
One of the Pacific Islands, we read,
is so small that the House of Commons
could not be planted on it. A
great pity.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
"Do hotel chefs use cookery-books?"
asks a home journal. Our own opinion
is that quite a large
proportion of them cook
by ear.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
Fourteen thousand
artificial teeth recently
stolen from premises in
East London have not
been recovered. While
not attempting to indicate
the guilty party,
we cannot refrain from
pointing out that several
Labour leaders have recently
been showing a
good many more teeth
than they were thought
entitled to possess.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
At the Trades Union
Congress a protest was
made against the Unemployment
Insurance
Act. This must not be
confused with the
miners' threat to strike.
That is merely a method of ensuring
unemployment.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
The arrangement by which a hundred-and-fifty
amateur brass bands are to
play at the Crystal Palace on September
25th looks like an attempt to distract
us from the miners' strike fixed
for that day.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
A Ramsgate man charged with shooting
a cat denied that he fired at it. The
animal is said to have dashed at the
bullet and impaled himself upon it.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
It has been agreed, says a news item,
that milk shall be tenpence a quart
this winter. Not by us.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
The War Office announces that Arabs
in Southern Mesopotamia have captured
a British armoured train. It should be
pointed out to these Arab rebels that
it is such behaviour as this that discourages
the tourist spirit.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
Upon reading that another lady had
failed in her attempt to swim the
Channel a Scotsman inquires whether
the Cross-Channel steamer rates have
been increased, like everything else.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
We are informed that at a football
match recently played in the Rhondda
Valley the referee won.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
General <span class="sc">Obregon</span>, says an unofficial
message, has been elected President
of Mexico. The startling report that
he has decided to reverse the safe
policy of his predecessors and recognise
the United States requires corroboration.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
Everybody should economise after a
great war, says an American film producer.
We always do our best after
every great war.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
According to an official report only
fifty policemen were bitten by dogs in
London last week. The falling off is
said to be due to the fact that it has
been rather a good year for young and
tender postmen.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
Some highly-strung persons, says a
medical writer, are even afraid of inanimate
objects. This accounts for many
nervous people being afraid of venturing
too near a plumber.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
"I only want the potatoes in the
allotment and not the earth," said a
complainant at Deptford. It is evident
that, if this man is a trade unionist, he
is a raw amateur.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
Doctors at Vicenza have threatened
to strike. This means that people in
that neighbourhood will have to die
without medical assistance.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
"Chief Hailstorm," of the Texas
Rangers, has arrived in London. His
brother, Chief Rainstorm, has, of course,
been with us most of the summer.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
Girls, declares a well-known City
caterer, are acquiring bigger appetites.
We somehow suspected that the demand
for a return of the wasp waist
had influential interests behind it.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
The wife of a miner in Warwickshire
has recently presented her husband
with three baby boys. We understand
that Mr. <span class="sc">Smillie</span> is sorry to have missed
three extra strike-votes
which he would have
obtained had the boys
been born a little earlier.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
An extraordinary
story reaches us from
North London. It appears
that during the
building of a house a
brick slipped unnoticed
from a hod and fell into
its correct position,
with the result that the
accountant employed
by the bricklayers could
not balance his books
at the end of the day.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
"As science measures
time," declares an eminent
geologist, "the
Garden of Eden was a
thing of yesterday."
All we can say is,
"Where was Councillor

<div class="stanza">
<p>Ere your native country figured as the home of winter sport,</p>
<p>Paradise of spies and agents, and for kings a last resort;</p>
<p>Ere the hospitable chamois lent his haunts to Bolsh and Hun</p>
<p>Or the queue of rash toboggans took the curve of Cresta Run;</p></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Long before a locomotive climbed the Rigi, cog by cog,</p>
<p>Fame had mentioned your forefathers&mdash;such a noble breed of dog,</p>
<p>How they tracked the lonely traveller with their nimble, sleuthy snouts,</p>
<p>Till beneath a billowy snowdrift they remarked his whereabouts.</p></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>How they dug him out of cold-store like a Canterbury sheep,</p>
<p>Took their tongues and kindly licked him where his nose had gone to sleep,</p>
<p>Called attention to the cognac which they wore in little kegs</p>
<p>And remobilised the stagnant circulation in his legs.</p></div>

<h3>THE PRODIGIES.</h3>
<p>
We&mdash;Great-aunts Emily and Louisa&mdash;had in our innocence
been telling a few old fairy stories at bedtime to those
three precocities whom our hosts call their children.</p>
<p>
We knew that they talked Latin and Greek in their sleep
and were too much for their parents in argument, but we
thought that at least, at the story hour&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>
We were stopped by Drusilla. "I don't think much of
the moral of that one," she remarked. "It would seem to
illustrate the Evil Consequences of Benevolence!"</p>
<p>
"But she came alive again," said Evadne, the youngest,
in extenuation.</p>
<p>
"And the wolf was killed," we ventured in defence of
our old story.</p>
<p>
"Still," persisted Drusilla, "you couldn't call it encouraging."</p>
<p>
"Then in the other case," went on Claude thoughtfully,
"considering that she had been left in sole charge of the
house and had no business to go out and leave it to the
mercy of burglars, what moral are we to draw from the fact
that she married a Prince and lived happily ever afterwards?"</p>
<p>
"Most of them have that sort of moral," said Drusilla.
"And they are every one of them devoid of humour, except
of the most obvious kind&mdash;no subtlety."</p>
<p>
"When <i>I</i> was your age," said poor Louisa gently, "I
used to laugh very heartily over the adventures of <i>Tom
Thumb</i>."</p>
<p>
Claude seemed touched. "There are some capital situations
in certain of them," he conceded, "which might be
quite effectively treated."</p>
<p>
"How?" we asked weakly.</p>
<p>
It was Drusilla, the most alarming of the children, who
finally undertook to sketch us out an example.</p>
<p>
After a short meditation, "Something like this," she said.
"The situation, of course, you have met with before, but as
remodelled you might call it&mdash;</p>
<br /><br />

<h4>THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE;</h4>
<h4><span class="sc">or,</span></h4>
<h4><span class="sc">The Bad Fairy Foiled</span>.</h4>
<p>
A certain King and Queen had one daughter, to whose
christening they invited a large company, forgetting as
usual a particularly important and bad-tempered Fairy, who
signified her annoyance in the usual manner.</p>
<p>
The attendants of the little Princess (having read their
story-books) were preparing dolefully enough to fall asleep
for a hundred years, when the Fairy, with a contemptuous
sniff, remarked that the spell would not take effect for some
time yet.</p>
<p>
They breathed again and had almost forgotten the affair
by the time the Princess had grown up. But the Fairy had
so arranged it that the spell fell upon the Princess at the
time when she was engaged in making her choice of a
husband from among the suitors who had arrived at her
father's Court.</p>
<p>
The Princess was now bewitched in this way&mdash;that good
men appeared bad, ugly men handsome, and <i>vice versâ</i>.
The Fairy had hoped that she would thus make a mess of
her matrimonial affairs and live unhappily ever after.</p>
<p>
But she had reckoned without the disposition of the
Princess, a kind good girl with an overpowering sense of
duty. When pressed to choose, she replied firmly, "I will
have no other than Prince Felix."</p>
<p>
To her his ugliness seemed pathetic and his character
evidently needed reformation so urgently that she longed
to be at the job. No one wondered at her choice, for he
was, of course, the most handsome and excellent of men.</p>
<p>
Ultimately the Fairy broke her spell in a fit of exasperation,
but without any gratifying result. The Princess seemed
happier than ever and would sometimes say to a slightly
puzzled friend:&mdash;</p>
<p>
"Hasn't Felix improved <i>wonderfully</i> since I married
him?"</p>

   <hr />
<blockquote><p>
"From 1910 to 1916 he was Viceroy in India, governing the
Dependency through very critical years and enjoying general esteem,
as was made clear in 1912, when an attempt was made to assassinate
him at Delhi."&mdash;"<i>Daily Mail" on Lord Hardinge</i>.</p></blockquote>
<p>
It sounds like a <i>succès d'estime</i>.</p>

<h3>THE COAL CUP.</h3>
<p>
It seems to me that we all take a
great deal of interest in the miners
when they strike, but not nearly enough
when they hew. And yet this business
of hacking large lumps of fuel out of a
hole, since civilisation really depends
on it, ought to be represented to us
from day to day as the beautiful and
thrilling thing that it really is. Yet if we
put aside for a moment Mr. <span class="sc">Smillie's</span>
present demands, we find the main topics
of discussion in the daily Press as I
write are roughly these:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>
(1) The prospects of League Football
and the Cup Ties.</li>
<li>
(2) Ireland.</li>
<li>
(3) The prevalence of deafness
amongst blue-eyed cats.</li>
<li>
(4) Mesopotamia.</li>
<li>
(5) The Fall of Man.</li>
<li>
(6) The sale of <i>The Daily Mail</i>, whose
circulation during the coming winter is
for some reason or other supposed to
be almost as important to the children
of England as their own.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Of all these topics the first is, of
course, by far the most absorbing, and
almost everyone has remarked how the
love of sport, for which Britons are
famous, is growing more passionate than
ever. It is not only cricket and football,
of course; only the other day
there was a shilling sweepstake on the
St. Leger in our office and, from what
I hear of the form of Westmorland in
the County Croquet Championship during
the past season&mdash;but I have no
time to discuss these things now.</p>
<p>
The point is that, whilst this excitement
over games grows greater and
greater, the country is suffering, say
the economists, from under-production
and the inflation of the wage-bill. This
means that everyone is trying to do
less work and get more money for it,
a very natural ambition which nobody
can blame the miners from sharing. I
suppose that if they all stopped mining
and we had to depend for warmth on
wrapping ourselves up in moleskins,
the molliers, or whatever they are called,
would strike for a two-shillings rise as
well.</p>
<p>
The worst of it is that under-production,
say the economists again (there is
no keeping anything from these smart
lads), sends prices up. Obviously then
there is only one thing to do: we must
take advantage of the prevailing passion
and make mining (and other industries
too for that matter) a form of sport.
The daily papers should find very little
difficulty in doing this.</p>

<h5>
WHO HEWS HARDEST?<br />
CLAIM BY A LANARKSHIRE COLLIER</h5>

<p>
would do very well for the headings of
a preliminary article; and the claim of
the Lanarkshire collier would, I am
sure, be instantly challenged. After a
few letters we might have a suggestion,
say from Wales, that no team of eleven
miners could hew so hard and so much
as a Welsh one. And from that it
would be only a short step to the formation
of district league competitions
and an international championship.
Or the old-time system under which
cricketers were matched for a stake by
sporting patrons might be revived, and
we should have headlines in the evening
Press after this fashion:&mdash;</p>

<h5>
HUGE HEWING CONTEST.<br />
NOTTS FOREST v. NEWCASTLE UNITED.<br />
TREMENDOUS WAGER BETWEEN<br />
THE DUKES OF PORTLAND AND<br />
NORTHUMBERLAND</h5>

<p>
and all the glades of Sherwood and the
banks where the wild Tyne flows would
be glad.</p>
<p>
It will be objected, of course, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg 205]</span>
hewing of coal is not a spectacular
affair. You cannot pack sixty thousand
spectators into a mine to watch a hewing
match, and even if you could the
lighting is bad; but that is just where
the skill of the reporters would come
in. After all, we do not most of us see
the races on which we bet, nor the Golf
Championship, nor even <span class="sc">Beckett</span> and
<span class="sc">Wells.</span> But there would be articles
on the correct swing whilst hewing, and
the proper stance, and how far the toes
should be turned in; the chances of
every team would be discussed; the
current odds would be quoted, and, whoever
won, the consumer would score,
whilst the strongest hewers would become
popular heroes and be photographed
on the back-page standing
beside their hews.</p>
<p>
I admit that the South of England
and London in particular would have
very little share in these competitions,
and we should depend for local interest
mainly upon the promising young colts
from the Kentish nurseries. But we
could find out from our dealers where
our coals came from and follow from afar
the fortunes of our adopted teams; and
Cabinet Ministers, at any rate, could
distribute their patronage and their
presence with tact over the various
areas involved.</p>

<h5>
MR. BALFOUR HEWS OFF AT<br />
DURHAM</h5>

<p>
is another headline which seems to
suggest itself, and I should strongly
urge the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>, who has returned,
I hear, with a St. Bernard from
the Alps, to lose no time in selecting a
more appropriate playmate.</p>

<h5>
PREMIER AT TONYPANDY.<br />
MR. LLOYD GEORGE PATS PET<br />
PIT-PONY

<p>
is the kind of thing I mean, and very
hard also to say six times quickly without
making a mistake.</p>
<p>
Obviously the result of all this would
be that not only would the miners be
justified in asking for more money, but
that the country would be able to afford
it; and similar competitive leagues, to
supersede trade unions, would soon be
formed by other trades. One seems
to hear faintly the loud plaudits of the
onlookers as two crack teams of West-end
road-menders step smartly into the
arena....</p>

<h3>SEVEN   WHITEBAIT.</h3>
<p>
Here and there in the drab routine
of modern existence it is still possible to
catch an occasional glimpse of romance
and courageous living, and in the
volume which lies before us as we
write we are given a generous measure
of peril and adventure in faery seas
forlorn. <i>From Whitebait to Kipper:
The Story of Seven Lives</i>, is the vivid
record of a family of herrings, set down
(posthumously, it would seem) with refreshing
simplicity by Walter Herring,
the youngest and perhaps the most brilliant
of the family. The story begins
with the early childhood of Walter,
John, Isabel, Margaret, Rupert, Stéphanie
and little Foch, the last of whom
was so named because he was born on
the anniversary of the Armistice. (As
a matter of fact they were all born on
the same day, but for some reason which
is not explained only one of them was
called Foch.)</p>
<p>
You, reader, are one of those ignorant
people who do so much discredit to our
Public Schools. You fondly think that
the whitebait is a special kind of fish,
that there are father whitebaits and
mother whitebaits and baby whitebaits.
You are wrong. There are only baby
whitebaits. At least there are baby
herrings and baby pilchards, and these
are called whitebait because they are
eaten by the mackerel and because
they look white when they are swimming
upside down.</p>
<p>
Anyhow Walter and John and Isabel
and Margaret and Rupert and Stéphanie
and little Foch began life as whitebait.
They used to charge about the Cornish
seas with whole platefuls of other whitebait,
millions of them, and wherever they
went they were pursued by thousands
of mackerel, who wanted to eat them.
One day John felt that the moment was
very near when he would be eaten by
a mackerel, and he was quite right.
Isabel felt the same thing, but she was
wrong. She jumped out of the water
and was eaten by a sea-gull. When
the fishermen saw Isabel leaping into
the air they came out and caught the
mackerel in a net. They also caught
Margaret with a lot of other whitebait;
and she was eaten by a barrister at
"Claridge's."</p>
<p>
There were now four of the family
who had not been eaten by anyone. It
is extraordinary when you come to
think of it that any herring ever contrives
to reach maturity at all. What
with the mackerel and the seagulls and
the barristers, everybody seems to be
against it. However, Walter, Rupert
and Foch succeeded. Stéphanie just
missed. Walter and Rupert and Foch
had jolly soft roes, a fact which is
recorded in a cynical little poem by the
precocious Foch, believed to be the
only literary work of a whitebait now
extant. We have only space here to
quote the opening couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The herrings with the nice soft rows</p>
<p>Are gentlemen; the rest are does.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
The survivors of the family had now
to choose a career. From the beginning
it seems to have been recognised that
Stéphanie at least would have to be content
with a humbler sphere than her
more gifted brothers. She had a hard
roe and was rather looked down upon.
But she was an independent little thing
and her pride revolted at a life of subjection
at home; so while still a girl she
went off on her own and got mixed up
with some pilchards who were just being
caught in a net. Stéphanie was caught
too and became a sardine. She was
carefully oiled and put in a tin, and she
was eaten at a picnic near Hampton
Court. But there is every reason to
suppose that she was eaten happy,
since in those less exacting circles
nobody seemed to mind about her hard
roe, which had been a perpetual bugbear
to her in the herring world.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the remaining three had
decided on a career. They were determined
to be fresh herrings. This is
of course the highest ambition of all
herrings, though sadly few succeed in
attaining it. One herring in his time
plays many parts (<span class="sc">Shakespeare</span>); he
can seldom say with confidence what
exactly he will be to-morrow; but he
can be fairly certain that it won't be a
fresh herring. Of our three survivors
Rupert alone was to win the coveted
distinction. He grew to be a fine boy
and was eaten at Hammersmith, where
his plump but delicate roe gave the
greatest satisfaction. It was not eaten
in the ordinary humdrum way, but was
thickly spread on a piece of buttered
toast, generously peppered, and <i>devoured</i>.
And when his "wish" was placed on
the kitchen-range, swelled rapidly and
burst with a loud report, his cup of
happiness was full.</p>
<p>
Little Foch, alas, failed to fulfil his
youthful promise and became a common
bloater. Worse than that, he was
bloated too thoroughly and was almost
impossible to eat. Even his lovely roe,
the pride of his heart, became so salt
that the Rector of Chitlings finally rejected
it with ignominy, though not
before he had consumed so much of it
that he had to drink the whole of his
sermon-water before he began to preach.</p>
<p>
But it was Walter, Walter the
chronicler, Walter the clever, the
daring, the ambitious, leader in every
escapade, adviser in every difficulty,
who was to suffer the crowning humiliation.
Walter became a kipper. If
there is one thing that a herring cannot
stand it is to be separated from his roe.
Walter's roe was ruthlessly torn from
him and served up separate on toast,
with nothing to show that it was the
glorious roe of Walter. It was eaten
at the Criterion by a stockbroker, and
it might have been anybody's roe.
Meanwhile the mutilated frame, the
empty shell of Walter, was squashed
flat in a wooden box with a mass of
others and sold at an auction by the
pound. It broke his heart.</p>

<h3>A DIFFERENCE OF CLASS.</h3>

<p>
It is without doubt the most expensive
hotel on the front, and the palatial
dining-room in which we have just
lunched is furnished and decorated in
that sumptuously luxurious style to
which only wealth, untrammelled by art,
is able to attain. Personally I cannot
afford to take my meals at such places,
and I know that the same holds good
of my fellow-guest, Charteris. Charteris
was the best scholar of our year at
Oriel, and since his demobilisation he
and his wife have been living in two
rooms, except during the periods
when their son joins them for
his holidays from Winchester.
But our host is still possessed
of an obstinate wealth which
even the War has done little to
diminish, and, as he himself puts
it, is really grateful to those of
his old friends who will help
him in public to support the
ignominy.</p>
<p>
At the moment, having finished
lunch, we have betaken ourselves
to wicker-chairs in the porch,
and Charteris and our host being
deep in a golf discussion I venture
once more to turn a covert
attention to the exceedingly
splendid couple who have just
followed us out from the dining-room.
I noticed them first on
my arrival, when they were just
getting out of their Rolls-Royce,
and the admiration which I
then conceived for them was
even further enhanced during
lunch by a near view of the
lady's diamonds and of the
Cinquevalli-like dexterity shown
by her husband in balancing a
full load of peas on the concave
side of a fork. At present the
man, somewhat flushed with
champagne, is smoking an enormous
cigar with a red-and-gold
band round it, while the lady, her diamonds
flashing in the sunshine, leans
back in her chair and regards with
supercilious eyes the holiday crowds
that throng the pavement below.</p>
<p>
Following her glance my attention is
suddenly arrested by the strange behaviour
of two passers-by, who have
stopped in the middle of the pavement
and, after exchanging some excited comments,
are staring fixedly towards us.
From their appearance they would seem
to be a typical husband and wife of the
working-class on holiday, and it occurs
to me that, given the clothes and the
diamonds, they might well be occupying
the wicker-chairs of the couple opposite.
Evidently the sight of somebody
or something in the hotel porch
has excited them greatly, for they continue
to stare up at us with a hostile
concentration that renders them quite
unconscious of the frantic efforts of
the small child who accompanies them
to tug them towards the beach. After
a moment they exchange a few more
quick words, and the man leaves his
companion and makes his way towards
us. Ascending the hotel steps with an
air of great determination he comes to
a halt before the couple opposite.</p>
<p>
"'Ere, I've bin lookin' for you," he
begins accusingly.</p>
<p>
The  Rolls-Royce owner takes the
cigar from his mouth and gazes in astonishment
at the accusing apparition
before him.</p>
<p>
"A hour ago," pursues the newcomer
relentlessly, "you was driving along
the front here in the whackin' great car.
It ain't no good denyin' it, 'cos I took
the number."</p>
<p>
"What d'ye mean&mdash;denying it?" exclaims
Rolls-Royce. "Who's denying
anythink?"</p>
<p>
"It ain't no good tryin' to deny it,"
retorts the other. "An' it ain't no good
denyin' wot you did neether, 'cos I've
got my missus 'ere to prove it."</p>
<p>
"What I did?" echoes the astonished
man. "What did I do?"</p>
<p>
"Ran over my child's b'loon," states
the accuser, fixing him with a pitiless
eye. For the moment the object of
this serious charge is too taken aback
to be capable of speech.</p>
<p>
"'Ran over my child's b'loon,'" repeats
the other inexorably. "Leastways
your chauffer did. An' when we 'ollered
out to yer to stop you just rushed on
like a runaway railway-train."</p>
<p>
Rolls-Royce, conscious of the curious
gaze of the entire company, pulls himself
together and regards his accuser
unfavourably.</p>
<p>
"First I've 'eard of it," he growls.
"Where was the balloon anyway? In
the road, I s'pose?"</p>
<p>
"Yes, it <i>was</i> in the road,"
retorts the other defiantly,
"where it's got every right to
be. Road's there for the convenience
of b'loon-fliers just as
much as for motor-cars. More."</p>
<p>
"Look 'ere, that's enough of
it," says the car-owner harshly.
"If the balloon got run over
it's yer own fault for letting it
go in the road."</p>
<p>
"That's a nice way to talk,"
suddenly comes in shrill tones
from the woman below, who
has edged her way to the foot
of the steps. "We don't go
buyin' balloons for you to run
over in yer cars. We're respectable
people, we are, an' we work
for our livin'."</p>
<p>
"Drivin' about in a car like
an express train, runnin' over
other people's b'loons," corroborates
her husband bitterly.
"Wot country d'yer think yer
in? Prussia?</p>
<p>
By this time a small crowd
has gathered on the pavement
and is gazing up at the protagonists
with ghoulish interest.
The lady in the diamonds, a
prey to mingled indignation and
alarm, has leant towards her
spouse and is whispering to him
urgently, but he shakes her off
with an impatient movement.</p>
<p>
"Not on yer life," he snaps. "They
won't get a cent out o' me."</p>
<p>
"Ho, won't we!" exclaims his accuser
hotly. "We'll soon see about that.
We're English people, we are&mdash;we
don't allow people to go about destroyin'
our b'loons."</p>
<p>
"No wonder they're so rich," cries
the woman at the bottom of the steps
in satirical tones. "That's the way
to get rich, that is&mdash;destroyin' other
people's prop'ty an' then refusin' to
pay for it. Anybody could get rich
that way."</p>
<p>
Reflections on the feasibility of this
novel financial scheme are cut short by
the appearance at the top of the steps
of the hotel porter, who touches the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg 209]</span>
originator of the disturbance on the
shoulder.</p>
<p>
"Come on, you're not allowed up
'ere, you know," he observes.</p>
<p>
"Ho, ain't I?" retorts the man defiantly.
"Is this Buckingham Pallis?"</p>
<p>
"You can't come up 'ere unless you've
got business in the 'otel," states the
porter unmoved.</p>
<p>
"So I 'ave got bisness 'ere," declares
the other. "Bisness c'nected with my
son's b'loon."</p>
<p>
"An' we don't leave 'ere till it's
settled, neither," cries the lady on the
pavement. "'Alf-a-crown that balloon
cost, an' we don't budge from 'ere till
we get it."</p>
<p>
This is altogether too much for the
owner of the Rolls-Royce.</p>
<p>
"'Alf-a-crown?" he explodes and
turns indignantly to the company.
"'Alf-a-crown for a child's balloon, and
<i>then</i> they go on strike."</p>
<p>
Derisive cheers and counter-cheers
go up from the crowd below as the
incensed balloon-owner bursts forth
into an impassioned defence of his inalienable
right as a free-born Briton to
strike or to buy half-crown balloons as
the spirit moves him. Simultaneously
the lady in the diamonds rises and,
producing a coin from her gold bag,
holds it with a superb gesture at arm's
length beneath his nose. For a moment
or two he pays no attention to her,
then takes the coin impatiently with
the air of one brushing aside an irritating
interruption and continues his
harangue.</p>
<p>
"Come on," puts in the porter;
"you've got yer 'alf-crown. S'pose
you move on."</p>
<p>
"Got me 'alf-crown, 'ave I'?" he
retorts. "Wot about my rights as a
man? Does 'alf-a-crown buy them?"</p>
<p>
No one venturing to solve this social
problem he turns slowly and, glaring
over his shoulder at Rolls-Royce, descends
the steps.</p>
<p>
"I'm an Englishman, I am," he concludes
from the pavement. "No one
can't close my mouth with 'alf-crowns."</p>
<p>
For a brief space he stands scowling
up at the porch as though challenging
all and sundry to perform this feat,
then, taking his wife by the arm, moves
off with her and the still insistent
child towards the beach. The crowd
on the pavement, regretfully convinced
that the entertainment is at an end,
disperses slowly. Rolls-Royce, seemingly
unconscious of the interest of
Charteris and our host, who are looking
at him covertly as at some zoological
specimen, relights his cigar and sits
glowering across the road, and silence
falls upon the scene&mdash;a silence broken
at last by the lady in the diamonds,
who has resumed her languid pose in
the wicker-chair.</p>
<p>
"'Orrible people!" she observes, addressing
the occupants of the porch
generally. "Nice state o' things when
you can't even be safe from 'em in yer
own 'otel. You don't seem to be able
to get away from these low-class people
hanywhere&mdash;you don't reely!"</p>

<p>
The heightened stature of women was
a favourite topic in anthropometric
circles long before the War. It seems,
however, that they are not going to
rest content with their present standard
of altitude, but are invoking the resources
of Art to render it even more
conspicuous. We do not speak rashly
or without book. <i>The Evening News</i>
announced on September 8th that
"Women are to be taller this autumn."
Nature may be in the Fall, but women
are on the rise. The mode by which
this effect of elongation&mdash;so dear to
Art&mdash;is to be attained is described in
detail by the Paris correspondent of
our contemporary as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>
"A fluffy and very high head-dress
will be worn this autumn. The effect is
obtained by the aid of pads, and adds
some inches to a woman's stature....
Another type of coiffure is being adopted
by some hairdressers, who leave the
hair flat and smooth round the face,
and only make a sort of bird's-nest of
the ends, which stand well up so as to
lengthen the profile in an upward
direction."</p>
<p>
Nothing, however, is said about the
relation of fashion to the physique of the
sterner sex. To correct this omission
Mr. Punch has interviewed a number
of West-End tailors, hatters, hosiers
and bootmakers. The results of this
inquiry may be briefly summarised.</p>
<p>
Heads are to be larger this autumn,
and to keep pace with the extraordinary
development of brain amongst our insurgent
youth, as evidenced by the
correspondence in <i>The Morning Post</i>,
it has been found necessary to make
a radical change in the stock sizes of
hats. But, where there has been no
cranial distension, provision will be
made to remedy the defect by the insertion
of a cork sheath, by the aid of
which a head of undersized circumference
will be able to wear a No. 8
hat. Again, to meet the needs of customers
in whom the temperature of
the cranial region is habitually high, a
hat has been devised with a vacuum
lining for the insertion of cold water.
The "Beverley" nickel-plated refrigerating
helmet, as it is called, has already
found a large sale amongst Balliol
undergraduates.</p>
<p>
As a result of the revival of the "Apes
<i>v.</i> Angels" controversy, in which Canon
<span class="sc">Barnes</span> has taken so prominent a part,
and Mr. <span class="sc">Bottomley</span> has declared himself
as a whole-hearted supporter of
<span class="sc">Darwin</span> (<i>vide</i> his article in <i>The Sunday
Pictorial</i>), hands will be supple and
boneless this autumn, as in fashionable
portraits. This reversion to the prehensile
type of hand, so noticeable in
the chimpanzee, has its drawbacks,
and the rigidity necessary for certain
manual functions, such as winding up
a motor or opening a champagne bottle,
will be furnished by gloves of a stiffer
and stronger fabric, ranging from simulation
leatherette to chain-mail.</p>
<p>
Owing to the continued over-crowding
of trains, tubes and motor-buses,
elbows will be more prominent and
aggressive than ever, and tailors are
building a type of coat calculated to
relieve the strain on this useful joint
by a system of progressive padding,
soft inside but resembling a nutmeg-grater
at the point of contact with the
enemy.</p>
<p>
It only remains to be added that in
consequence of the publication of the
Jewish Protocol and other documents
pointing to revolutionary and anarchical
Semitic activities, noses will be worn
straighter and <i>à la Grecque</i>,  and for
similar reasons feet will be shorter and
with more uplift in the instep.</p>

<h3>THE TAXATION OF VIRTUE.</h3>
<p>
"I shall wait," said Peter, "till they
send me the final notice."</p>
<p>
"Being his wife," said Hilda to me,
"I am in a position to know that he
will not. In another week he will pay,
saying that the thought of income-tax
has affected his nerves and that he can
bear it no longer. He wobbles like this
for six weeks twice a year, and meanwhile
his family starves."</p>
<p>
"Under our system of taxation," Peter
retorted, "the innocent must suffer."</p>
<p>
"It falls alike on the just and the
unjust," I interposed. "How else would
you have it?"</p>
<p>
"Naturally I would have it fall on
the unjust alone," he replied.</p>
<p>
"Why not on the just alone?" I
asked, suddenly aware of the birth of
an idea.</p>
<p>
"Of course you want exemption."</p>
<p>
"You miss my point. You grant that
taxation is necessary?"</p>
<p>
"For the sake of argument," said
Peter, "I grant that, with reservations."</p>
<p>
"Since then there must be taxes, why
not have taxes that it would be a pleasure
to pay? The current taxes are
not a pleasure to pay."</p>
<p>
"I grant that," said Peter, "without
reservations."</p>
<p>
"Now there is only one sort of tax
that I can imagine anybody paying
gladly, and that would be a tax on his
virtues."</p>
<p>
"Still hankering after your own exemption,"
growled Peter.</p>
<p>
"Leave me out of account. Take, by
preference, yourself. You have virtues
and are proud of them."</p>
<p>
Hilda intervened, as I had anticipated.
"The pride is admitted," said she, "but
as for the assessment value of the
virtues&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>
"Never mind that. You are proud of
your virtues"&mdash;I turned to Peter again&mdash;"yet
you are sometimes troubled,
like the rest of us, by a fear that you
may not really possess them after all.
But the assessment of your virtues by
the Board of Inland Revenue would
prove their existence to yourself and to
all the world."</p>
<p>
"Except his wife," said Hilda.</p>
<p>
"Her evidence would not be accepted.
If you had paid taxation for the possession
of a virtue, the receipt would be
a guarantee that you did possess that
particular virtue, and it would consequently
be a source of profound moral
satisfaction to you. You would pay
with pleasure. Besides, it is a poor
kind of virtue that will not abide a
test. The tax would be a test. Suppose
that five pounds was levied upon
you for honesty. If you refused to pay
how could you ever again claim to be
honest? You would be marked as not
valuing your honesty at five pounds.
No, you would pay and pay readily."</p>
<p>
My words were addressed to Peter,
but Hilda seemed the more interested.
"It sounds well, but how would you
raise the money?" she asked.</p>
<p>
"That would depend on the virtue,"
I replied. "The sobriety tax, for example,
would be levied on anyone who
had not for some years been convicted
of drunkenness."</p>
<p>
"But how about the virtues that you
don't get fined for not having&mdash;truthfulness,
unselfishness, kindheartedness
and all those?"</p>
<p>
"I admit that would be difficult.
Can you suggest anything?" I asked
Peter.</p>
<p>
"No," he answered. "I'm not encouraging
your rotten idea anyhow."</p>
<p>
"Could the revenue officials feel people's
bumps?" inquired Hilda reflectively.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg 215]</span>
<p>
"I'm afraid," I said, "people wouldn't
stand it. Fancy Peter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>
"I've got it," said Hilda. "The
revenue officials would attribute a virtue
to the taxpayer, and if he wanted
to escape taxation they would require
him to prove to them that he lacked
the virtue in question."</p>
<p>
"They would like doing that," muttered
Peter.</p>
<p>
"You have found the solution," I
said to Hilda. "If you impute to a
person a virtue he does not possess he
probably denies that he has it, but he
is really flattered and his denial is not
sincere. He would be willing to pay
on it; he would rather pay than not."</p>
<p>
At this point Peter grew tired of refraining
from comment. "I don't want
you to suppose," he said, "that I am taking
any interest in your fatuous scheme,
but doesn't it occur to you that under
your system it would be simply ruinous
to have any virtues at all, and that the
only people who would flourish would
be those who had no virtues and were
not ashamed of it?"</p>
<p>
"For one thing," I replied confidently,
"the taxes would be graduated in the
ordinary way in accordance with means.
The slightest flicker of a conscience
in Park Lane would be more heavily
mulcted than the most blameless life in
Bermondsey. But the main point is
that under my system taxation would
become the measure of a man's moral
worth, and people who did not pay
taxes would be simply out of it. All
the plums would go the highly-taxed
men. Their tax receipts would be certificates
of character, and the more they
earned the more the Treasury would be
able to get out of them. So far from
dodging taxation, people would scramble
to pay it."</p>
<p>
"But how," asked Hilda, "would you
make the tax receipt a trustworthy
testimonial? Your rich man with one
virtue would have a better receipt than
your poor one with ten."</p>
<p>
"The virtues taxed would be shown
on the receipt," I replied. "Besides,
poor and virtuous men would, as I have
suggested, get an abatement on their
virtue taxes, and the amount of the
abatement would be shown on the receipt.
So it could easily be seen what
proportion a man was paying on his
wealth and what on his virtues."</p>
<p>
"Look here," said Peter, aroused at
last, "do you convey that the tobacco
duty would be paid by people who
didn't smoke?"</p>
<p>
"It would amount to that," I answered,
"assuming that abstention from
tobacco were counted a virtue."</p>
<p>
"There may be something in it after
all," said Peter.</p>

<h3>THAT TEA INTERVAL.</h3>

<p>
Before the last ball of 1920 is bowled and the last wicket
in a first-class match falls (as will most probably happen at
the Oval this very afternoon, September 15th), I should like
to let the Gods of the Game know how I propose to spend
the following winter in their interests, so that when the
season of 1921 is with us the happiness of the cricket
spectator may be even greater than it has been in the one
now expiring.</p>
<p>
I am going to devote the time to invention. With every
grain of intellect and ingenuity that I can scrape together
I am going to devise a means of humanising the tea
interval.</p>
<p>
Once upon a time I was so rash as to ridicule this interruption.
I drew attention to the fact that the ancient
heroes of the game had been able to dispense with it.
<span class="sc">Alfred Mynn</span> needed no Asiatic stimulant between lunch
and the close of play. Even such wholehearted moderns
as <span class="sc">Hornby</span> and <span class="sc">Shrewsbury</span> and <span class="sc">Grace</span> managed to do
well without the support of Hyson or Bohea. For more
than a century cricket and tea were strangers and cricket
did not suffer. And so on. But the attacks were futile: the
tea interval became an institution; and nothing now, one
realises, can ever occur to separate the gallant fellows from
their cups and saucers.</p>
<p>
That being accepted, the problem is how to make the
interval at once less harmful to the match and more tolerable
to the lover of cricket; and it is on this problem that I have
been working and intend to work through the arid football
months. What has to be done is (<i>a</i>) to get the interval
abbreviated; and (<i>b</i>) to keep the players on the field. It is
the length of it and the empty pitch that are so depressing
to the spectator, and it is the return to the pavilion that is
so detrimental to the rhythm of the game. Neither of the
batsmen ever wants the interruption, and I have often
noticed a reluctance in certain members of the fielding side.
As for the watchers, they never fail to groan.</p>
<p>
Still, as I have said, it is now recognised that the craving
for tea is as much a part of the present-day game as the
six-ball over, and the time has passed for censuring it.
But something can be done to regulate it; and I have based
my efforts towards a solution on the argument that, if a
cricketer is not called in from the game to read his telegram,
but (as we have all seen so often) the telegram is
taken out to him, surely the precious fluid that he so passionately
desiderates can be taken out to him too. At present,
therefore, all my thoughts are turned upon the construction
of some kind of wheeled waggon, such as is in
use at a well-known restaurant in the Strand, on which
fifteen cups (two for the umpires) and an urn and sugar and
milk can be conveyed, with the concomitant bread-and-butter,
or shrimps or meringues, or whatever is eaten with
the tea, on a lower shelf. This could be pushed on to the
ground at 4.15 and pushed back again at 4.20 without any
serious injury to the match. That is my idea at the
moment; but I am a poor mechanic and should be glad
if some properly qualified person&mdash;someone with a <span class="sc">Heath
Robinson</span> mind&mdash;would take the work over.</p>

<h4>IN THE MOVEMENT.</h4>

<p>
How I came to be able to understand the language of
trees is a secret. But I do understand it. It is my
peculiar privilege to overhear all kinds of whispered conversation&mdash;green
speech in green shades&mdash;as I take my
rest underneath the boughs on a country walk. Some day
I shall set down fully the result of these leaves-droppings,
but at the moment I want to tell only of what I heard some
blackberry bushes saying last week.</p>
<p>
"From what I hear," said the first bush, "the cost of
everything's going up by leaps and bounds."</p>
<p>
"How is that?" asked one of its neighbours.</p>
<p>
"It's due, I understand," the first bush replied, "partly
to scarcity of labour and partly to profiteering."</p>
<p>
"I don't see why we shouldn't participate," said another
bush. "Here we are, covered with fruit, and it's all just as
free as ever it was. That's absurd, after a big war. The
duty of a war is to make things dearer and remove freedom."</p>
<p>
"Of course," said the others.</p>
<p>
"'Your blackberries will cost you more'&mdash;that should be
our motto," said the first bush. "We must be up to date."</p>

    <hr class="short" />
<p>
A few days later, after one of our infrequent post-bellum
gleams of sunshine, I met the Lady of the White House
and all her nice children returning from a day's blackberrying.
They showed me their baskets with a proper
pride, and I was suitably enthusiastic and complimentary.</p>
<p>
"But do look at our poor hands and arms and our torn
frocks!" said the lady. "We've picked blackberries here
year after year, but we've never been so badly scratched
before. It's extraordinary. I can't account for it."</p>
<p>
I could, though.</p>

<h3>THE MOON-SELLER.</h3>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>A man came by at night with moons to sell;</p>
  <p class="i2">"Moons old and new," he cried;</p>
<p>I hurried when I heard him call for me;</p>
<p>He set his basket on the wall for me</p>
  <p class="i2">That I might see inside</p>
<p>And watch the little moons curl up and hide.</p></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Each one he touched rang softly like a bell;</p>
  <p class="i2">He pointed out to me</p>
<p>Great harvest moons with russet light in them,</p>
<p>Pale moons to gleam where snows grow white in them,</p>
  <p class="i2">Red moons for victory,</p>
<p>And steadfast moons for men in ships at sea.</p></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The man who came with many moons to sell</p>
  <p class="i2">Opened his basket wide;</p>
<p>Showed me the filmy crescent moons in it,</p>
<p>And the piled discs (like silver spoons) in it</p>
  <p class="i2">That push and pull the tide,</p>
<p>And small sweet honey-moons to give a bride.</p></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"This moon," he said, "you will remember well;</p>
  <p class="i2">Its price is wealth untold;"</p>
<p>Took a camp-moon he vowed he stole for me</p>
<p>And softly wrapped to keep it whole for me.</p>
  <p class="i2">I heaped his feet with gold;</p>
<p>He changed, and said the moon might not be sold.</p></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Then I was angry that with moons to sell</p>
  <p class="i2">He thought he had the right</p>
<p>To keep that one. Those who were lent to us</p>
<p>Had written the brief notes they sent to us</p>
  <p class="i2">When it shone out at night.</p>
<p>I caught it to my heart and held it tight.</p>

traders have settled up their affairs and come into India. In order to
avoid being questioned by British poets in the Khyber, they have
entered this country by way of the Sissobi pass."&mdash;<i>Indian Paper.</i></p>

Some of our poets are notoriously curious, and we are
hardly surprised to learn that the Afghans could not "abide
their question."</p>

<h3>THE  LANGUAGE   DIFFICULTY.</h3>
<p>
"The jolly part about an island
where there are no towns and no railways,"
said Willoughby, "is that you
have thrills of excitement as to where
you will sleep next night or eat your
next meal. Now when we land at
Lochrie Bay to-morrow it will be nearly
lunch-time; but shall we get lunch?"</p>
<p>
"I can answer that," replied MacFadden,
whose grandfather was a Scotsman,
and who was once in Edinburgh
for a week; "the map shows it is only
five miles to Waterfoot, and there's
sure to be an hotel there. Those little
Scots inns are all right."</p>
<p>
"Yes," chimed in Sylvia, "and very
likely there'll be nothing to eat when
we get there. I am thinking
of you three men, of
course," she added hastily;
"we girls don't want
much."</p>
<p>
"As for me," said Willoughby,
looking at Sylvia,
whom he has adored
dumbly for years, "very
little satisfies me. I'm
like the fellow who said, 'a
crust of bread, a bottle of
wine and you.' You know
the chap, MacFadden."</p>
<p>
"Isn't it wonderful how
he remembers his <span class="sc">Omar</span>?"
remarked Mac enthusiastically.</p>
<p>
"I don't know much
poetry," said Willoughby,
whose tastes are sporting
rather than literary, "but
I always liked that bit."</p>
<p>
"But lunch," I interposed,
"is the pressing
question. There's sure to
be an hotel at Waterfoot,
as you say. Send a telegram there,
asking for lunch for six. If there's no
hotel, no reply and no lunch. If there
is we get our reply and our lunch.
Willoughby can wire, because he learned
all about telegraphs in the army."</p>
<p>
Within two hours came the reply. I
opened it.</p>
<p>
"Will supply luncheon for six, 1.15
to-day."</p>
<p>
"Can you remember what your wire
said, Willoughby?" I asked mildly.</p>
<p>
"Rather. 'Can you provide luncheon
for six at 1.15.&mdash;Willoughby.'"</p>
<p>
"Exactly. Can't you see, you silly
ass, how you've muffed it? Read this."
Willoughby read, while Sylvia and
Molly looked over and giggled.</p>
<p>
"Hang it all! I suppose I ought to
have said to-morrow," he sighed. "Here,
Thompson, you and Hilda, as the married
couple of the party, ought to deal
with these beastly emergencies."</p>
<p>
"Not I," I replied. "You've got us
in the muddle, now get us out. Wire
and say it's for to-morrow."</p>
<p>
"And then," said my practical wife,
"we shall get to-day's hot lunch cold
to-morrow, and a rapacious Scotch-woman
will charge us for it twice
over."</p>
<p>
"I wish you would say 'Scots,' not
'Scotch,'" complained MacFadden.</p>
<p>
"Sorry, Kiltie," rejoined Hilda; "and
perhaps one of you two will deal with
the Scots woman."</p>
<p>
"Leave her to me and none of you
interfere," answered MacFadden. "Willoughby
is no good at a job that needs
tact. He's not half as lovable as I am
either. Is he, Molly? We'll send the
wire at once. Come on."</p>
<p>
Next day the steamer dropped us
into the ferry-boat off Lochrie Bay, and
our bicycles, more frightened than hurt,
but much shaken, were hurled in after
us. After five miles on a primitive
road we arrived at the hotel very late.</p>
<p>
MacFadden, assuring us that if we
only kept quiet he would see us through
in spite of any Scots innkeeper, led the
way.</p>
<p>
The landlady, a dour woman, appeared.</p>
<p>
"Good morning, Madam," began Mac
politely.</p>
<p>
"Will you be Mr. Willoughby?" she
replied.</p>
<p>
"No," said Mac truthfully, assuming
a puzzled expression.</p>
<p>
"Weel, then," resumed the lady, addressing
Sylvia, who happened to be
close behind, "will you be Mrs. Willoughby?"</p>
<p>
Molly sniggered; Sylvia reddened
and answered hastily, "No, I won't!"
at which Willoughby sighed audibly.</p>
<p>
"What I wanted to ask you was
whether perhaps you could be so kind
as to give us a bit of bread and cheese
or something," said Mac ingratiatingly.
"Of course one doesn't expect a proper
lunch in these places without ordering
it beforehand."</p>
<p>
"And those that order beforehand
dinna come," she replied with some asperity.
"A pairty of six ordered for yesterday
then they telegraphs to say
they mean to-day, and now they're no
here and the time lang gone by. I
thocht ye were the pairty at first."</p>
<p>
"What a shame!" murmured MacFadden
sympathetically.</p>
<p>
"Ay, if they had turned up they should
hae had their lunch, and
paid for it too," said the
good lady grimly. "Twa
days they should hae paid
for. But if ye like ye can
eat their lunch for them;
it's cauld but guid."</p>
<p>
So we ate heartily, paid
reasonably and went away
on good terms with ourselves
and the lady.</p>
<p>
Walking up the steep
hill from the hotel I was
just behind Willoughby
and Sylvia. He was pushing
the two bicycles and
explaining something elaborately.</p>
<p>
"Awfully sorry about
that silly woman, Sylvia,"
he said, "but it's only their
rotten way of talking English.
You see, when she
says, '<i>Will</i>  you be Mrs.
Willoughby?' she really
means, '<i>Are</i>  you?' It's
not the same as when an
Englishman says it. If I said, 'Will
you be Mrs. Willoughby?' that would
be different; it would mean&mdash;"</p>
<p>
"Yes," interrupted Sylvia rather
breathlessly, "that, Tommy dear, would
be plain English, to which I could give
a plain answer. I should say&mdash;"</p>
<p>
We had reached the brow of the hill.
I mounted my bicycle and hurried on.</p>

<h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

<h4><span style="font-weight: normal;">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</span></h4>
<p>
Really I think that <i>Rhoda Drake</i> (<span class="sc">Murray</span>) must be the
most preposterously startling story that I have read for
this age. It makes you feel as if you had had a squib
exploded under your chair at a temperance meeting. After
beginning placidly about persons who live in South Kensington
(and are so dull that the author has to fill up with
minute descriptions of their drawing-rooms), somewhere
towards three-quarters through its decorous course it
plunges you head over ears into such tearing melodrama
as is comparable only to Episode 42 of "The Adventures
of the Blinking Eye" at a provincial cinema. I am left
asking myself in bewilderment whether Mr. <span class="sc">C.H. Dudley
Ward</span>, D.S.O., M.C., can have been serious in the affair.
As I say, practically all the early characters are of little
or no account, including <i>Rhoda</i>  herself. Indeed, nobody
looks like mattering at all, and the whole tale has, to be
frank, taken on a somewhat soporific aspect, when lo!
there enters a lady with a Russian name, no back to her
gown and green face-powder. If I said of this paragon
that she made the story bounce I should still do less than
justice to her amazing personality. Really, she was a
herald of revolution, whose remarkable method was to
invite anyone important and obstructive to her house and
make them discontented. It was the work of half-an-hour.
Whether the process was hypnotic, or whether she actually
put pepper in the ice-pudding, I could not clearly make out.
But the dreadful fact remained that, let your patriotism be
ever so firm, you had but to accept one of green-powder's
little dinners and next morning you were as like as not to
hurl a stone into 10, Downing Street. As for the end&mdash;!
But no, I will stop short of it.</p>

     <hr />
<p>
Frankly, what pleased me most about <i>Affinities</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder
and Stoughton</span>) was its attractive get-up; pleasant, cherry-pie-coloured
boards, swathed in a very daintily-drawn
pictorial wrapper, the whole, as cataloguers say, forming an
ideal birthday present for a young lady, especially one at all
apt to discover, however harmlessly, the affinities that
give these five tales their title. As for the stories themselves,
really all that need be said is to congratulate Mrs.
<span class="sc">Mary Roberts Rinehart</span> on the ingenuity with which she
can tell what seems an obvious intrigue yet keep a surprise
in reserve. I suppose it is because they come to
us from America that certain of the episodes turn upon
incidents in the Suffrage struggle, tale-fodder that our own
militant novelists have long happily discarded. Of the
others I think I myself would award the palm to one
called "The Family Friend," a genially cynical little comedy
of encouraged courtship, of which the end seems to be
visible from the beginning, but isn't. Altogether, what I
might call a Canute; in other words a book for the deck-chair,
not too absorbing to endanger your shoes, however
close you read it to the advancing wave.</p>

<hr />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg 220]</span>
<p>
I think I should best describe the characteristic quality
of <i>Four Blind Mice</i> (<span class="sc">Lane</span>) as geniality. The scene of it
is Burmah&mdash;astonishing, when you consider the host of
novels about the rest of India, that so few should employ
this equally picturesque setting&mdash;and it is quickly apparent
that what Mr. <span class="sc">C.C. Lowis</span> doesn't know at first hand
about Rangoon is not likely to be missed. The tale itself is
a good-humoured little comedy of European and native
intrigue, showing how one section of the populace strove
as usual to ease the white man's burden by flirtation and
gossip, and the other to get the best for themselves by unlimited
roguery and chicane. The whole thing culminates in
a trial scene which is at once a delightful entertainment and
(I should suppose) a shrewdly observed study of the course
of Anglo-Burmese justice. I think I would have chosen
that Mr. <span class="sc">Lowis</span> should base his fun on something a little
less grim than the murder and mutilation of a European,
or at least Eurasian,
lady, even though the
very slight part in
the action played by
<i>Mrs. Rodrigues</i>, when
alive, could hardly be
called sympathetic.
Still we were all so
good-humoured over
her taking-off that
for a long time I
cherished a rather
dream-like faith in
her reappearance to
prove that this attitude
had been justified.
Not that Mr.
<span class="sc">Lowis</span> has not every
right to retort that
he is writing comedy
rather than farce; certainly
he has made
his four blind mice
to run in highly diverting
fashion, very
entertaining to those
of us who see how
they run; and as they
at least save their tails
triumphantly it would perhaps be ungenerous to complain
about one that doesn't.</p>

<i>The Story of the Fourth Army in the Battles of the Hundred
Days</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</span>) is printed on pages
the size of a copy of <i>Punch</i>, and with its accompanying case
of maps it costs eighteen-pence to go through the post. It
boasts a hundred full-page photographs, also sketches,
charts, maps, panoramas and diagrams <i>ad lib.</i>, a foreword
by General Lord <span class="sc">Rawlinson</span> and ten appendices; so really
it seems that the much-abused word "sumptuous" may for
once be fairly applied. The author, Major-General Sir <span class="sc">A.
Montgomery</span>, who himself helped to "stage" the battles he
writes about, has built up a record which is in some sense
unique, for I think it is possible from this book to trace
precisely where any unit of the Fourth Army was placed, and
what doing, at any given hour during the whole of the victory
march from Amiens to the Belgian frontier. Apart from anything
else it is pleasant to have a book that deals only with
the days of victory; but it must be admitted that, to gain a
completeness of detail so entirely satisfactory to those most
nearly concerned, the writer has had to sacrifice something
of human interest, for many of his pages are little more than
a bare chronicle of names and places. Undoubtedly his book
should be read with great deliberation, constant reference
to the maps and a lively recollection of personal experiences
on the spot; but the civilian reader may still be content
to skim the text and save himself for the photographs.
These, mostly taken from the air and of exquisite technical
quality, form an amazing series, in themselves worth the
heavy price. And who minds heavy prices when the proceeds
are pledged to the service of wounded officers?</p>

     <hr />
<p>
"Rather an anti-climax," I thought when I opened <i>The
Happy Foreigner</i> (<span class="sc">Heinemann</span>) and found that it purported
to tell the experiences of an English <i>chauffeuse</i> in France
after the Armistice; but I know now that, in any place
where <span class="sc">Enid Bagnold</span> happened to be, there would not be
any anti-climax about. In a style so daring and vivid that
it could only have been born, I suppose, of fast driving, the
authoress describes a
romantic affair with a
young French officer;
but her real theme is
the suffering of France
bowed down under the
intolerable burden of
so many strangers,
both enemies and
friends. The rich and
well-fed Americans
who will not trouble
to understand, the
grotesque Chinamen
and Annamites, the
starving Russians liberated
from the Germans,
flash by, with
the ruins of villages,
the tangle of wire
and litter of derelict
guns; and even the
romance, intensely
felt though it is, must
be fleeting, like the
rest of the nightmare,
because the Frenchman's
eyes are set
on the future and
the rebuilding of his fortunes. This book is not "about
the War," but all the same it is one of the best books
about the War that I have read.</p>

     <hr />
<p>
<i>From a Common Room Window</i> (<span class="sc">Owen</span>) will be a slight
refreshment to those who are weary of realistic studies of
schoolmasters and schoolboys. "<span class="sc">Orbilius</span>," during what
I take to have been a long career as a teacher, has not
allowed his sense of humour to wither within him. In a
note to his slender volume of sketches he says, "School-life
is largely a comedy. When a schoolmaster ceases to recognise
this it is time for him to 'bundle and go.'" He has
been in the main a keen and sympathetic observer, and
though his remarks upon headmasters are a little severe&mdash;personally
I should hate to be called "a meticulous pedagogue"&mdash;I
do not think that a little criticism of these potentates
will do them the smallest harm. In "The Castigator"
"<span class="sc">Orbilius</span>" gives a laughable sketch. The inventor of a
flogging machine is soundly beaten by his own instrument,
and he would be a sombre man indeed who could
read it without a desire to witness such a chastening performance.
By no means the least merit of this book is
that it contains no new theories about education.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
